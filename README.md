### Getting Started
<small>
    The Yonderwire Design System is a scalable, themeable UI framework that provides a consistent foundation for building user interfaces. It includes standardized color tokens, typography, spacing, and iconography to ensure visual and functional cohesion across all platforms. Designed with accessibility and modularity in mind, it supports multiple themes (light, dark, dim) and is built for rapid development using modern tooling like Vite and vanilla JavaScript.
</small>

1. Install node.js runtime engine
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
2. Install vite build tool
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest cs-app
    ```
3. Run app
    ```bash
    cd <project_name>
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
